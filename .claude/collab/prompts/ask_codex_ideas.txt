You are an AI trading system architect reviewing the Gaussian Options Trading Bot.

CURRENT BEST CONFIGURATION (VALIDATED OOS):
- Temporal Encoder: TRANSFORMER (not TCN!)
- Training: 10K cycles on Sept-Nov 2025
- Entry: Bandit mode (HMM-based)
- Exit: -8% stop loss, +12% take profit, 45-minute max hold
- **Training Result: +2777% P&L, 35.8% WR, 1706 trades**
- **December OOS Result: +32.65% P&L, 27.4% WR, 61 trades**
- Env var: TEMPORAL_ENCODER=transformer

CRITICAL LEARNINGS (DO NOT VIOLATE):
1. Training P&L does NOT predict OOS performance
2. ALWAYS validate on out-of-sample period before deployment
3. Transformer encoder generalizes better than TCN/LSTM
4. The 59.8% WR from dec_validation_v2 is NOT reproducible - stop trying
5. Longer training (20K+) makes model selective but with WRONG predictions

FAILED APPROACHES (DO NOT RETRY):
- 20K+ pretrain to get conservative predictions (18.4% WR - worse than random)
- Dynamic exit evaluator (cuts positions too early)
- Contrarian mode (catches fake reversals)
- V3 Multi-Horizon with TCN (overfits, loses OOS)

KNOWN ISSUES TO SOLVE:
1. Exit ratio asymmetry (-8%/+12%) requires 40% WR to break even
2. Prediction horizon (15min) mismatches hold time (45min)
3. Win rate drops ~8% from training to OOS (35% → 27%)

RECENT EXPERIMENTS:

HARDWARE AVAILABLE:
- 2x Tesla P40 GPUs (48GB total VRAM)
- Can run 4 experiments in parallel

VALIDATION REQUIREMENT:
- All ideas MUST be tested on out-of-sample period (December 2025)
- Training P&L is meaningless - only OOS P&L matters

Please suggest 3-5 NEW improvement ideas focusing on:
1. Improving OOS generalization (the main problem)
2. Exit strategy improvements (asymmetry is a known issue)
3. Combining Transformer with V3 Multi-Horizon
4. Feature engineering for better OOS
5. Reducing gap between training and OOS performance

For each idea, provide:
- title: Short descriptive title
- description: What to change
- hypothesis: Why this might improve OOS performance
- category: entry/exit/architecture/features/risk/training
- priority: critical/high/medium/low
- env_vars: Environment variables to set for testing
- validation_plan: How to validate OOS

IMPORTANT:
- Focus on OOS performance, NOT training performance
- All ideas must include TEMPORAL_ENCODER=transformer (proven best)
- Prioritize quick-to-test ideas (config changes via env vars)
- Output valid JSON that can be appended to idea_queue.json
