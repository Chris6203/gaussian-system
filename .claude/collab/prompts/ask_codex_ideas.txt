You are an AI trading system architect reviewing the Gaussian Options Trading Bot.

CURRENT BEST CONFIGURATION:
- Method: 3-month pretrained predictor, tested on current month (walk-forward)
- Entry: Bandit mode (HMM + Neural confirmation)
- HMM thresholds: trend > 0.70 (bullish) or < 0.30 (bearish), confidence > 0.70
- Exit: -8% stop loss, +12% take profit, 45-minute max hold
- **BEST Result: 59.8% win rate, +$338.86 per-trade P&L, +413% total P&L**

BASELINE (without pretraining):
- 40.9% win rate, +$1.40 per-trade P&L, +85% total P&L

KNOWN ISSUES:
1. Exit ratio asymmetry (-8%/+12%) requires 40% win rate just to break even
2. Prediction horizon mismatch (predicting 15min but holding 45min)
3. Neural predictions are unreliable (~50% accuracy) - hence HMM-only works better
4. Transformer architecture implemented but untested

KEY LEARNINGS (DO NOT SUGGEST THESE AGAIN):
{INSERT_LEARNINGS}

RECENT EXPERIMENTS:
{INSERT_RECENT_EXPERIMENTS}

HARDWARE AVAILABLE:
- 2x Tesla P40 GPUs (48GB total VRAM)
- Can run 4 experiments in parallel

Please suggest 3-5 NEW improvement ideas across these categories:
1. Exit strategy (stop loss %, take profit %, max hold time, trailing stops)
2. Entry strategy (HMM thresholds, confidence requirements)
3. Architecture changes (temporal encoder type, normalization, activations)
4. Feature engineering (new signals, indicators, data sources)
5. Risk management (position sizing, daily limits)
6. Training methodology (walk-forward, ensemble, different loss functions)

For each idea, provide:
- title: Short descriptive title
- description: What to change
- hypothesis: Why this might improve results
- category: Which category above
- priority: high/medium/low
- env_vars: Environment variables to set for testing (if applicable)
- files_to_modify: Which files need changes (if any code changes needed)
- estimated_complexity: low/medium/high

IMPORTANT:
- Focus on ideas NOT already in the failed_approaches list
- Prioritize quick-to-test ideas (config changes via env vars)
- Consider the exit ratio problem as top priority
- Output valid JSON that can be appended to idea_queue.json
